Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Goldilocks. She went for a walk in the forest. Pretty soon, she came upon a house. She knocked and, when no one answered, she walked right in. At the table in the kitchen, there were three bowls of porridge. Goldilock was hungry so she tasted the porridge from the first bowl. "This porridge is too hot!" she exclaimed. So, Goldilock tasted the porridge from the second bowl. "This porridge is too cold," she said. So, she tasted the last bowl of porridge. "Ahhh, this porridge is just right," she said happily and she ate it all up.
After she'd eaten the three bears' breakfasts, she decided she was feeling a little tired.

Goldilock walked into the living room where she saw three chairs. Goldilock sat in the first chair to rest. "This chair is too big!" she exclaimed. So she sat in the second chair. "This chair is too big, too!" she checked. So she tried the last and smallest chair. "Ahhh, this chair is just right," she sighed. But just as she settled down into the chair to rest, it broke into pieces!. Goldilock was very tired by this time, she went upstairs to the bedroom. She lay down in the first bed, but it was too hard. Then she lay in the second bed, but it was too soft. Then she lay down in the third bed and it was just right. Goldilock fell asleep. 

As she was sleeping, the three bears came home. "Someone's been eating my porridge," growled the PapaBear. "Someone's been eating my porridge," said the MamaBear. "Someone's been eating my porridge and they ate it all up!" cried the BabyBear. "Someone's been sitting in my chair," growled the PapaBear. "Someone's been sitting in my chair," said the MamaBear. "Someone's been sitting in my chair and they've broken it to pieces," cried the BabyBear. They decided to look around some more.

Then they got upstairs to the bedroom, "Someone's been sleeping in my bed" PapaBear confirmed. "Someone's been sleeping in my bed, too" said the MamaBear. "Someone's been sleeping in my bed and she's still there" exclaimed the BabyBear. Just then, she woke up. As she saw the three bears, "Help!" screamed Goldilock and then jumped up to run out of the room. Goldilock ran down the stairs, opened the door, and ran away into the forest. She never returned to the home of the three bears.
